## The Bioconductor site

The [Bioconductor site](http://www.bioconductor.org) has a wealth of great information.  Here are some pointers

- Package vignettes are a very important source of information for Bioconductor packages.  You can access package vignettes from the help menu in RStudio or from the package page on Bioconductor.
- [Workflows](http://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/).  This is a new addition to Bioconductor; the intention is to provide across-package description of useful functionality.
- [Software packages](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software); note the use of `biocViews` to the left of the page, this might be useful if you are searching for specific functionality.

## Other resources

- The [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org); this is a great place to ask questions.
- The [posting guide](http://bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/) for the Bioconductor support site.  Read this before asking questions; it will maximize your chance of getting a useful answer.
- [Stack Overflow (R)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r); this is a popular help site for computer programming.
- [Stack Overflow (Bioconductor)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bioconductor); this is a popular help site for computer programming.
- [R Documentation](http://www.rdocumentation.org/); a search engine for all documentation from all packages from CRAN and Bioconductor.
- [R Seek](http://rseek.org); like 'R Documentation" but it also search a few other sites and is based on a different search engine.

## Getting Vignettes in R

Package vignettes are installed inside of R.  You can access vignettes in the following ways

1. Through the online help (for example in RStudio).
2. Through the `vignettes()` function in R, but that requires you know the name of the vignette.
3. Through the `browseVignettes()` function in `r Biocpkg("Biobase")` which shows a list of installed vignettes in a browser (this is a different interface to the RStudio help interface).
